# The Kingdom of Algorithmia (2024)

Initial attempt at everybody codes. 

https://everybody.codes/event/2024/quests

Each quest folder contains 3 files:
- questx.test.ts: contains the unit tests
- questx.ts: contains the solution
- questx.txt: contains the sample data

# Usage Codespaces (Easy)
The template has been defined to be used with GitHub Codespaces:
1. Create a repository from the template (Click "Use this Template").
3. Open the newly created repository using code space
4. After installation - Accept the request to install Extension ViTest
5. Open bash session (in the terminal), and execute ```pnpm i```

# Usage (outside Codespaces)
If you don't want to use codespaces, then the project can still be used within your own vscode installation, but you will need to install the following software:
- node
- pnpm
- git

To get started:
1. Create a repository from the template (Click "Use this Template").
2. Clone the newly created repository on your machine
3. Open with VsCode
4. Accept the request to install Extension ViTest
5. Open bash session (in the terminal), and execute ```pnpm i```
